# The Great Gatsby: American Dream and Moral Decay
## A Literary Analysis

## Introduction

F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece "The Great Gatsby" (1925) stands as one of the most profound literary examinations of the American Dream and its inherent contradictions. Set against the backdrop of the opulent and morally ambiguous Jazz Age, Fitzgerald crafts a narrative that simultaneously celebrates and critiques America's obsession with wealth, status, and reinvention. Through the enigmatic figure of Jay Gatsby and his doomed pursuit of Daisy Buchanan, Fitzgerald reveals how the corrupted values of 1920s America ultimately lead to disillusionment and tragedy. This report examines the novel's key themes, symbolic elements, and character dynamics to demonstrate how Fitzgerald's work transcends its historical context to offer timeless insights into human nature and society.

## Plot Summary

Nick Carraway, a Yale graduate and World War I veteran, moves to West Egg, Long Island, to work as a bond salesman in New York City. He rents a small house adjacent to the lavish mansion of the mysterious Jay Gatsby, who hosts extravagant parties every weekend. Across the bay in the more fashionable East Egg lives Nick's cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom, a former Yale classmate of Nick's.

As Nick becomes acquainted with the social circles of East and West Egg, he discovers that Gatsby's entire existence is built around his desire to reunite with Daisy, whom he loved before the war but lost due to his poverty. Having amassed a fortune (through questionable means), Gatsby believes he can reclaim Daisy by displaying his newfound wealth and status. When Nick arranges a reunion between Gatsby and Daisy, they begin an affair that threatens her marriage to the unfaithful but possessive Tom.

The novel reaches its climax during a confrontation at the Plaza Hotel, where Tom exposes Gatsby's criminal connections. Afterward, Daisy, driving Gatsby's car, accidentally kills Tom's mistress, Myrtle Wilson. Gatsby takes the blame, and Myrtle's husband George, misled to believe Gatsby was both Myrtle's lover and killer, murders Gatsby before taking his own life. The novel concludes with Gatsby's sparsely attended funeral, highlighting the hollowness of the relationships he cultivated and the dream he pursued.

## Analysis of Major Themes

### The Corruption of the American Dream

Fitzgerald portrays the American Dream—the belief that anyone, regardless of origin, can achieve prosperity through hard work and determination—as fundamentally corrupted. Gatsby's transformation from James Gatz, a poor farm boy, to Jay Gatsby, a wealthy socialite, initially appears to embody this ideal. However, Fitzgerald reveals that Gatsby's wealth comes not from honest labor but from bootlegging and organized crime, suggesting that the traditional path to success has been replaced by moral compromise.

The green light at the end of Daisy's dock, which Gatsby gazes at longingly, symbolizes not only his desire for Daisy but also the illusory nature of the American Dream itself—always visible but ultimately unattainable. As Nick reflects, "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us." This poignant observation captures how the pursuit of an idealized future can lead to perpetual dissatisfaction with the present.

### Class Division and Social Mobility

Fitzgerald meticulously delineates the social stratification of 1920s America through the geographical separation of East Egg (old money) and West Egg (new money). Despite his enormous wealth, Gatsby remains an outsider to the East Egg elite, who view him with a mixture of curiosity and disdain. Tom Buchanan, born into privilege, dismisses Gatsby as "Mr. Nobody from Nowhere," highlighting how entrenched class boundaries resist the American myth of social mobility.

The Valley of Ashes, an industrial wasteland between West Egg and New York City, represents those crushed beneath the wheels of capitalism. The residents of this desolate area, including George and Myrtle Wilson, have no access to the wealth and privilege enjoyed by the novel's main characters, demonstrating how the prosperity of the Jazz Age failed to reach all segments of society.

### Appearance versus Reality

Throughout the novel, Fitzgerald explores the disparity between appearance and reality. Gatsby constructs an elaborate persona to conceal his humble origins, claiming to be "an Oxford man" and the inheritor of family wealth. This fabricated identity reflects the novel's broader concern with authenticity in an era characterized by performance and spectacle.

Similarly, the Buchanans' marriage projects an image of aristocratic stability while concealing Tom's infidelity and the couple's fundamental unhappiness. The lavish parties at Gatsby's mansion, filled with "men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars," create an atmosphere of glamour and excitement that masks the host's profound loneliness and the guests' spiritual emptiness.

## Character Analysis

### Jay Gatsby

Gatsby embodies both the possibilities and limitations of self-invention in America. His transformation from James Gatz to Jay Gatsby demonstrates remarkable ambition and determination, yet his reinvention is ultimately superficial. Despite his carefully cultivated image, he cannot escape his past or truly belong among the social elite. His blind devotion to an idealized version of Daisy—"the girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs"—reveals his tendency to replace reality with fantasy, a fatal flaw that leads to his downfall.

### Daisy Buchanan

Daisy represents the allure and emptiness of the American aristocracy. Her voice, which Gatsby describes as "full of money," symbolizes the seductive power of wealth. Yet beneath her charm lies a profound moral carelessness. After killing Myrtle Wilson, she retreats into the protection of her social class rather than accepting responsibility. Her decision to remain with Tom instead of choosing Gatsby reveals her ultimate allegiance to security and status over authentic emotion.

### Nick Carraway

As both participant and observer, Nick provides a moral framework for evaluating the novel's events. His claim to be "one of the few honest people that I have ever known" establishes him as a relatively reliable narrator, though his fascination with Gatsby colors his perspective. Nick's journey from initial enchantment with the glamorous world of East and West Egg to disillusionment after Gatsby's death parallels the reader's growing awareness of the moral bankruptcy beneath the glittering surface of the Jazz Age.

## Symbolic Elements

### The Eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg

The faded billboard depicting the eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg overlooking the Valley of Ashes serves as a powerful symbol of divine judgment in an increasingly secular world. These "brooding eyes" witness the moral transgressions of the characters, including Tom and Myrtle's affair and the hit-and-run that kills Myrtle. George Wilson's misinterpretation of the billboard as the eyes of God watching over human affairs highlights the spiritual vacuum of the modern era, where commercial imagery has replaced religious iconography.

### The Weather

Fitzgerald skillfully uses weather to reflect the emotional temperature of scenes. The oppressive heat during the confrontation at the Plaza Hotel intensifies the tension between Gatsby and Tom, while the rain during Gatsby and Daisy's reunion symbolizes the washing away of the five years they spent apart. The transition from the heat of summer to the coolness of autumn as the novel progresses mirrors the cooling of Daisy's passion for Gatsby and foreshadows his tragic end.

## Conclusion

"The Great Gatsby" endures as a masterpiece of American literature because it captures a pivotal moment in the nation's cultural evolution while exploring timeless questions about identity, aspiration, and moral responsibility. Through his portrayal of Jay Gatsby's doomed pursuit of an impossible dream, Fitzgerald offers a profound critique of American society that remains relevant nearly a century after the novel's publication.

The novel's final lines—"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past"—encapsulate its central tragedy: the impossibility of escaping history and fulfilling the promise of complete self-reinvention. In this sense, Gatsby's failure is not merely personal but representative of the limitations inherent in the American Dream itself. By exposing the contradictions at the heart of this national mythology, Fitzgerald created not just a period piece about the Jazz Age but a timeless meditation on the human condition.
