        "1. **UCB Interpretation**: The problem mentions UCB, but since it’s a static graph problem, a greedy approach by expected gain is more appropriate. In a true UCB setting, we’d need trials to estimate the expected gains and balance exploration/exploitation.\n",
        "2. **Budget Constraint**: The budget of 7M allows selecting up to 7 nodes (if each costs 1M), but the problem asks for the top 3. If the costs were different, we’d need to adjust the selection process.\n",
        "3. **Graph Dependencies**: The current approach assumes nodes are independent once selected. If selecting a node affects the probabilities of others (beyond the DAG structure), we’d need a more complex model (e.g., dynamic programming).\n"
