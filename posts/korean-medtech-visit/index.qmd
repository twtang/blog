## AITRICS: Predictive AI for Critical Care and Patient Safety  

### Overview of AITRICS  
Next, I visited AITRICS, a company pushing the boundaries of AI in critical care. Founded in 2015, AITRICS focuses on predictive analytics to save lives and improve workflows for medical staff. Their mission is to utilize AI to detect and predict patient deterioration early, particularly in high-stakes environments like ICUs, general wards, and emergency rooms.

### AITRICS’ AI Solutions: VitalCare and Beyond  
AITRICS’ flagship product, **AITRICS-VC (VitalCare)**, predicts patient deterioration using AI-based medical devices. It integrates with electronic health records (EHRs) to monitor vital signs, blood tests, and Glasgow Coma Scale data in real time. The system supports scoring tools like:  
- **MEWS (Modified Early Warning Score):** Assesses six parameters (heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, blood pressure, mental status, urine output) to flag deterioration.  
- **NEWS (National Early Warning Score):** Uses similar metrics, adjusted for hospital settings, to predict adverse events.  
- **q-SOFA (Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment):** Identifies sepsis risk.  
- **SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment):** Evaluates organ dysfunction.  
- **APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II):** Scores ICU patients for severity of disease.  

AITRICS-VC predicts risks like:  
- Sepsis, major adverse events (CPR, unexpected ICU transfer, mortality).  
- Acute kidney injury, pulmonary embolism, department expansion needs.  

The system’s integration with EHRs allows real-time data access on hospital PCs, enabling early warnings via single-screen views of MEWS, NEWS, q-SOFA, SOFA, and APACHE II scores. This helps medical staff:  
- Improve diagnostic accuracy.  
- Increase bed turnover rates.  
- Reduce mortality through proactive interventions.  
- Enhance staff efficiency in emergencies.  

### Reflections
